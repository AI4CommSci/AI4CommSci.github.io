										</header>
										<p>
											The rapid advances in artificial intelligence don’t just change how we interact with 
											our speakers, choose TV shows to watch, or search for information online. They also change 
											what kind of science is possible and expand what it knowable. Established in 2024, 
											our group’s vision is to push the envelope of what is possible, making breakthroughs 
											in theory and practice for the communication sciences. In addition to our own research, 
											we seek to enhance the productivity of the field as a whole, through training junior 
											scholars and by disseminating methods, algorithms, and technology. Below, we highlight 
											a few major threads in our research. Space considerations mean leaving out a lot of cool 
											stuff; a full list of publications can be found <a href="Publications.html">here</a>. Another good source is the extensive 
											media coverage of our work, compiled <a href="Media.html">here</a>.

											<h2>Critical Periods for Learning a Second Language</h2>
										</header>

										<p>People who learned a second language in childhood are difficult to distinguish from native speakers,
											 whereas those who began in adulthood are often saddled with an accent and conspicuous 
											 grammatical errors. Despite being one of the oldest findings in the communication sciences, 
											 the reasons remain a mystery. For one thing, until very recently, it was unclear at exactly 
											 what age language learning becomes more difficult. By combining a dataset of unprecedented 
											 size (>600,000 people) and a novel analytic model, we showed that the rate of grammar learning
											  declines dramatically in late adolescence. 
										</p>

										<p>
											This is despite the fact that older learners have the advantage of having already learned a 
											first language. In a recent study, we showed that older children actually learn a new language 
											more rapidly than younger children — but in proportion to how similar their first language is 
											to the new language. (We do not yet know how this “linguistic transfer” affects the rate of 
											learning in adults.)
										</p>

										<p>
											We are currently trying to piece together exactly what is going on through a combination of 
											neuroimaging studies, computational modeling, and new behavioral studies with different types 
											of learners (for example, refugees or learners in immersion schools). 
										</p>

										<p>In the neuroimaging work, we are taking advantage of a machine learning-based method we developed
											 with our colleague <a href="https://sccnlab.bc.edu/people/">Stefano Anzellotti</a> at Boston College called “synthetic twin analysis”. 
											 This allows for quantifying variation in neuroanatomy with far more precision than was 
											 previously possible. Initial findings suggest that the fundamental nature of the neural basis 
											 of second language acquisition does not change until at least late adolescence – consistent 
											 with our behavioral findings. We are working to expand this work to look at adults.
										</p>

										<p>This work has been supported by a Simons Foundation SFARI and an NIH NRSA.

											<h2>What Makes Humans Such Efficient Language Learners?</h2>
										</header>

										<p>Humans are shockingly good at learning language. This has been clear to scientists for some 
											time, as one learning algorithm after another has been shown to be insufficient. Recent Large 
											Language Models only reinforce this point. We learn much faster than they do:
										</p>

										<p>
											Together with <a href="https://psychology.fas.harvard.edu/people/jesse-snedeker">Jesse Snedeker</a> at Harvard, we have proposed an account (Conceptual Nativism) that 
											treats language-learning as a kind of code-breaking. Unlike Llama or ChatGPT, learners have thoughts
											 and are trying to learn how to express them through language. This is obvious for any adult learner, 
											 but work in developmental psychology shows that this is likely true for babies as well. We argue – 
											 and are currently trying to show computationally – that this puts strong constraints on learning, 
											 vastly increasing the efficiency at which one can learn. Much of our work to date has focused on 
											 testing a central prediction of Conceptual Nativism, which is that even though grammar is often 
											 thought to be a set of arbitrary and opaque rules, in fact the grammars of the world’s languages are 
											 tightly constrained by meaning. (Grammar seems opaque because we only really notice the parts that 
											 are arbitrary, though in fact they actually rare.) In one case study after another, we show that this
											  is in fact the case.
										</p>

										<p>
											Some additional evidence comes from the observation that children acquiring two languages are even more 
											efficient than those acquiring only one. Naively, one might expect a bilingual-acquiring child to learn each
											 language at half the rate of their monolingual peers, but in fact on a per-language basis, they are much
											  faster. One possibility, which we are currently exploring, is that bilinguals are able to use what they 
											  have learned about each language to learn the other. 
										</p>

										<p>In current and planned work, we are building out computational models of Conceptual Nativism. This is an ambitious 
											task, as modeling how people learn to talk about their thoughts about the world requires good models of both 
											thought and the world.
										</p>

											<h2>Scaling the Cognitive and Behavioral Sciences</h2>
										</header>

										<p>Research in the communication and other cognitive/behavioral sciences is slow, because collecting data
											 is slow. While statisticians routinely report that robust & reliable results require collecting 
											 orders of magnitude more data than is typical, researchers often struggle to collect even that much.
											  We were one of a handful of research groups that pioneered collecting vast datasets through online 
											  games, quizzes, and citizen science. While many researchers want to do such studies, there is a 
											  significant barrier to entry.
										</p>

				
										<p>In order to address that barrier, we have developed free-and-open-source software (<a href="https://pushkin-consortium.github.io/pushkin/4.1/">Pushkin</a>) for running 
											massive citizen science experiments in the cognitive and behavioral sciences. This work has been supported by NSF 
											#2229631, #2318474, #2029637, #1551834.
