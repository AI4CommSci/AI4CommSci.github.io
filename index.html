											<h2>About L3@BC</h2>
										</header>
										<p>The Language Learning Lab at Boston College (L3atBC) is focused on some of the deepest, thorniest questions in the cognitive sciences:</p>
											<p><i>How is language learning possible when so many philosophical arguments suggest it shouldn't be?<br> Why do babies succeed at learning language, when animals, machines, and even adults fail?<br> What is the structure of language, and how does it relate to the structure of thought?<br> Why is there more than one human language?</i><p>
											<p>This might seem an impossible challenge, given that greater minds than ours have already tried and failed to solve these questions. Our approach is to find new, powerful methods that can provide critical insight that prior researchers lacked. This includes conducting <strong>massive citizen science projects</strong> with 100,000s of subjects, using <strong>novel analytics</strong>, and utilizing <strong>new & emerging computational modeling techniques</strong>. We also aim to speed discovery by making extensive use of methods for <strong>open, robust, & reproducible science</strong>.
