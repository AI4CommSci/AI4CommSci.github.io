                  <p><b>The four open positions are split between the Language Learning Lab and the Cooperation Lab. Descriptions of the two labs are listed below. Although interns will be assigned to one of these labs, students will gain exposure to both labs.</b></p>
                  <h3>The Language Learning Lab at Boston College (L3@BC)</h3>
                  <p>L3@BC’s research sits at the intersection between linguistics, neuroscience, artificial intelligence, and psychology. Only humans can learn language. It is beyond the abilities of event the smartest animals or the fastest computers. We study what gives humans this extraordinary ability. We use a variety of methods, including in-person studies with children, online viral quizzes, and computational models. We also coordinate citizen science projects, in which volunteer, amateur researchers help analyze linguistic phenomena.</p>
                  <h3>The Cooperation Lab at Boston College</h3>
                  <p>CL@BC’s primary research interest lies in understanding the development of cooperative abilities in children with a particular focus on how children develop a sense of fairness. We ask questions like 1) how do children use information about others' behaviors to guide their own actions and make predictions about other children’s behaviors? 2) Are children willing to make sacrifices to promote equality in unfair situations? 3) Are children able to make strategic choices about how to divide resources between themselves and a partner?
