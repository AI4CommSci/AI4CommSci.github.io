                  <h2>Summer Research Assistant Internship Program</h2>
                  <h3>The Summer 2019 Application Deadline Has Passed</h3>
                </header>

                  <p>The Language Learning Lab at Boston College (L3@BC), directed by Dr. Joshua Hartshorne, is seeking undergraduate research assistants for Summer 2019.  Students who desire more research experience and seek opportunities to contribute to various stages of the scientific process are encouraged to complete the appropriate sections of the application form below.</p>
                  <h3>About us:</h3>
                  <p>The Language Learning Lab at Boston College (L3@BC) opened in January of 2016. Our research sits at the intersection between linguistics, neuroscience, artificial intelligence, and psychology. Our strategy is to leverage new and emerging technologies to address previously unanswerable scientific questions. Methodologically, the lab uses a number of well-established methods, such as judgment studies, eye-tracking, and ERPs. However, we are particularly interested in exploring and exploiting new and emerging methods. One such method is testing tens or even hundreds of thousands of children and adults over the Internet, and in doing so being able to study questions that were previously out of reach. Positions are available in the following two areas of the lab:</p>
