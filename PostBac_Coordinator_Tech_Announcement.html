                  <h2>Post-bac Research Tech Position in the Language Learning Lab</h2>
                </header>
                  <p>The Language Learning Laboratory at Boston College, directed by Dr. Joshua Hartshorne, invites applications for a full-time research assistant (two year commitment, with possibility of extension). This position will support a National Science Foundation project to study how people learn languages. </p>
                  <p>Our research sits at the intersection between linguistics, neuroscience, artificial intelligence, and psychology. Our strategy is to leverage new and emerging technologies to address previously unanswerable scientific questions. This includes massive crowdsourcing efforts (our website, <a href="http://gameswithwords.org" target="_blank"> gameswithwords.org</a>, has been visited by over 2,000,000 volunteer researchers).</p>
                  <p>The only requirements for this position are a bachelor's degree or equivalent (in hand by start date), diligence, and the ability to work in teams. However, valuable skills and experiences include: prior research experience, training in linguistics, knowledge of non-English languages, computer programming or statistical skills, and experience with science outreach and public engagement. </p>
                  <p>You can learn more about this position <a href="PostBac.html" target="_blank">here</a>. Interested applicants should apply <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScAvV0C4l8Gh-4lwglI2pGroTrchAjMgnzpPsGXn__2q4arYg/viewform" target="_blank"> here</a>. Review will begin immediately and continue until the position is filled. If this ad is still up, the position has not yet been filled!</p>
                  <p>The position is available immediately but start date is flexible (though no later than 6/1/2020). We place a higher priority on the candidate than the start date.</p>
                  <p>Please address any questions to Eric Gu (guer@bc.edu).</p>
